Ideas for Breakout
==================

Feature Ideas
-------------
- Particles (upon ball hitting blocks, spark-type particles are emitted)
- Score
  - Better score for better times?
  - Certain blocks give more points than others
- Static blocks which can not be destroyed (unless by bombs?)
  - Level system
- More powerups:
  - Remove some time? (once score & time bonus have been implemented)
  - Bonus points
  - Slowmo/Path projection:
    - Time slows down, and you can see a projection of where the ball will go based on where the paddle is
